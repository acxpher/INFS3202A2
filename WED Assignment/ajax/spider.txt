While they're already looking at expanding the universe (with a Tom Hardy as Venom spin-off), this time around they've got Marvel involved in Spider-Man: Homecoming, with the addition of Tony "Iron Man" Stark in the mix, having already appeared (and been one of the major highlights) of Captain America: Civil War.

We're not quite sure why some of the previous Spider-Man movies have been considered flops - 2014's The Amazing Spiderman 2 made the least at the box office, but even that still made over $700 million worldwide - but critically it has seen a bit of diminishing returns - again, The Amazing Spiderman 2 scored the lowest, with just 52% on Rotten Tomatoes - but still a good sight better than most of the recent DC movies.

Anyways, one of the big gets they've got working on the new Spider-Man is Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino, who got his big break writing the score for Lost before moving on to the likes of Rogue One, Doctor Strange, Jurassic World and a lot of the recent Pixar movies.
