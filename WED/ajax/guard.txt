This past Friday, Star-Lord and his ragtag group of misfits became two-time galaxy savers as well as pushing Marvel Studios’ “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”  to soar at the box office as the number one movie with a galactic $146.5 million in its opening weekend!

That’s right, True Believers, what is summer without the Guardians! “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” opened 55% above the 2014 debut of “Guardians of the Galaxy.” Previously, “Guardians of the Galaxy” earned $94.3M, making it not only the biggest-ever August opening domestically, but also the biggest non-sequel opening of 2014—or for quite some time!
